			<p>Mar 30, 2017<br>
			
				The term "open source" refers to something people can modify and share because its design is publicly accessible.<br>

				<b>I believe in the fact that reading few lines of code is more worth than read 500 pages of a book</b>. When you follow code written by great programmers you automatically tend to pickup some great practices while coding.

				For beginners the first question that comes into mind is from where I have to start?<br><br>

				<b>How do I get started?</b><br>
				The first and the foremost thing is choose a programming language of your choice. Once you are done with selecting a programming language, search for a project you might be interested.<br>
				There are lot of websites like <a href="https://github.com/" target="blank">Github</a>, <a href="https://openhatch.org/" target="blank">Openhatch</a> available for beginners.<br><br>

				<b>What's the difference between open source software and other types of software?</b><br>

				Some software has source code that only the person, team, or organization who created it—and maintains exclusive control over it—can modify. People call this kind of software "proprietary" or "closed source" software.Only the original authors of proprietary software can legally copy, inspect, and alter that software.Eg:Microsoft Office and Adobe Photoshop<br>

				Open source software is different. Its authors make its source code available to others who would like to view that code, copy it, learn from it, alter it, or share it. Eg:LibreOffice and the GNU Image Manipulation Program .<br><br>

				Before contributing to open source first make sure you learn some version control system I'll suggest you to learn <a href="https://www.codeschool.com/learn/git/?searchsegment=ppcnonbrand&aid=701j0000002BMesAAG&promo=&oid=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=paidsearch&utm_campaign=CS_Git-google&utm_content=&utm_term=&gclid=CIevjdTY_dICFdGGaAod9UoBAw">  Git </a>. Read famous blogs about Git and open source<br>	
				I suggest you to read this one <a href="http://loudprogrammer.net/7-tips-for-contributing-to-open-source-projects-on-github-for-beginners/?utm_source=quora&utm_medium=answer" target="blank">Tips for contributing to open source projects on github for beginners.</a><br><br>


				An easy way to get started is through open source programs. Here are a couple that I know of:<br>
				<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="blank"> Google Summer of Code </a><br>
		 		<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Outreachy?action=show&redirect=OutreachProgramForWomen" target="blank"> 	OutreachProgramForWomen - GNOME Wiki! </a><br>
				<a href="https://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/" target="blank">Rails Girls Summer of Code </a><br>
					You are assigned mentors and coaches who will make sure that you get up to speed with the open source world. Not only that, it is a rare opportunity to get paid while you contribute to an open source project. <br><br>

				<b>If you have any questions regarding open source you can refer this <a href="https://opensource.com/resources" target="_BLANK">FAQ's regarding opensource.</a><hr><hr>
